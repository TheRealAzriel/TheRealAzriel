- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheRealAzriel
- ðŸ‘€ The name "Azriel" popped into my head back in my vanilla World of Warcraft days. It was a mysterious revelationâ€”or maybe just a late-night gaming epiphany. Inspired by Raziel, the star of Soul Reaver and one of my favorite spectral superheroes, I adapted it for my female Night Elf character. And voilÃ , "Azriel" was born and Molten Core was never the same!
- ðŸŒ± I currently work at the UofM in Tech Support. My work includes various areas such as Desktop Support, Programming and DevOps.
